It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.\n</p><p>Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM.

Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify <i>how</i> to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.\n</p><p>Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).\n</p><p>The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control.

Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger set of features and incorporate common extensions.

        "summary": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n\n<p>A <b>programming language</b> is a system of notation for writing computer programs.\nProgramming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler produces an executable program.\n</p><p>Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type (imperative languages—which implement operations in a specified order) developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, over time they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity.\n</p><p>Thousands of programming languages—often classified as imperative, functional, logic, or object-oriented—have been developed for a wide variety of uses. Many aspects of programming language design involve tradeoffs—for example, exception handling simplifies error handling, but at a performance cost. Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.\n</p>",

    "COBOL": {
        "summary": "<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n</p>\n\n<p><b>COBOL</b> (<span></span>; an acronym for \"common business-oriented language\") is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is an imperative, procedural, and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. Many large financial institutions were developing new systems in the language as late as 2006, but most programming in COBOL today is purely to maintain existing applications. Programs are being moved to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages, or replaced with other software.\n</p><p>COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on the programming language FLOW-MATIC, designed by Grace Hopper. It was created as part of a U.S. Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. It was originally seen as a stopgap, but the Defense Department promptly pressured computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has been revised five times. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2023.\n</p><p>COBOL statements have prose syntax such as <code class=\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-cobolfree mw-content-ltr\" style=\"\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>MOVE</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>TO</span><span> </span><span>y</span></code>, which was designed to be self-documenting and highly readable <span>to non-programmers such as management</span>. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words compared to the succinct and mathematically inspired syntax of other languages.\n</p><p>The COBOL code is split into four <i>divisions</i> (identification, environment, data, and procedure), containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs, and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions, and just one class.\n</p><p>COBOL has been criticized for its verbosity, design process, and poor support for structured programming. These weaknesses result in monolithic programs that are hard to comprehend as a whole, despite their local readability.\n</p><p>For years, COBOL has been assumed as a programming language for business operations in mainframes, although in recent years, many COBOL operations have been moved to cloud computing.\n</p>",
