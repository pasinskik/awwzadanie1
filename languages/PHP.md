## Description

<p><b>PHP</b> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group. PHP was originally an abbreviation of <i><b>Personal Home Page</b></i>, but it now stands for the recursive acronym <i><b>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</b></i>.
</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.
</p><p>The PHP language has evolved without a written formal specification or standard, with the original implementation acting as the <i>de facto</i> standard that other implementations aimed to follow. 
</p><p>W3Techs reports that as of 27 October 2024 (about two years since  PHP 7 was discontinued and 11 months after the PHP 8.3 release), PHP 7 is still used by 50.0% of PHP websites, which is outdated and known to be insecure. In addition, the even more outdated (discontinued for 5+  years) and insecure PHP 5 is used by 13.2% and the no longer supported PHP 8.0 is also very popular, so  the majority of PHP websites do not use supported versions.
